# heic2pdf
This is a python script that converts a heic image (.heic files are usually used by Apple when airdropping photos) to a pdf. 

NOTE: This will automatically grab your latest file in your Downloads folder. If you want this to work, just airdrop a photo to your computer, then run this script. It will then save the heic as a pdf file.

There is also an app that converts the .heic file to a pdf with one click.

• To use the app, unzip the file
• Then give the app full disk access in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Full Disk Access
• Now you can add the app to the dock or anywhere that is easily accessible :)
